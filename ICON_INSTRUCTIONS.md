# Icon Generation Instructions

The extension requires 4 icon sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels.

## Quick Method: Use the HTML Generator

1. Open `icons/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Right-click on each canvas and select "Save Image As..."
3. Save with the correct filename:
   - icon16.png
   - icon32.png
   - icon48.png
   - icon128.png
4. Place all files in the `icons/` directory

## Alternative: Use an Online Tool

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload any square image (logo, icon, etc.)
3. Generate icons in sizes: 16, 32, 48, and 128
4. Download and rename to match the required filenames
5. Place in the `icons/` directory

## Alternative: Use Design Software

Create icons using:
- Figma
- Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Canva

Design tips:
- Use a gradient from #667eea to #764ba2
- Add "LV" text in white (for LinkedIn Vault)
- Or use a vault/safe icon
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use any square PNG images renamed to the correct sizes. The extension will work with placeholder icons.
